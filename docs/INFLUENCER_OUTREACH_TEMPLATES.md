## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Personalize first line (mention specific video/topic)
✅ Be clear about payment amount upfront
✅ Keep it short (under 150 words)
✅ Include creative brief or examples
✅ Follow up once after 3-5 days
✅ Be professional but friendly

### DON'T:
❌ Generic "Dear Influencer" messages
❌ Vague "exposure" offers instead of payment
❌ Overly long emails
❌ Multiple follow-ups (max 1-2)
❌ Demanding or pushy tone
❌ Asking for free work "for portfolio"

---

## Response Rate Expectations

**Typical results:**
- Email open rate: 30-50%
- Response rate: 10-20%
- Acceptance rate: 5-10%

**To get 10 influencers to say yes:**
- Send 100-200 outreach emails
- Expect 20-40 responses
- 10-20 will be interested
- 10 will actually deliver

**Pro tip:** Over-recruit by 2x to account for flakes.
