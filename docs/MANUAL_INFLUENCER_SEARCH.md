   Upload the spreadsheet
   ```

2. **Segment by quality:**
   - A-tier: Perfect fit, has email, high ER
   - B-tier: Good fit, need to find email
   - C-tier: Maybe, lower priority

3. **Start outreach:**
   - Email A-tier first
   - DM B-tier on TikTok/Instagram
   - Keep C-tier as backup

## ROI Calculation

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours
**Cost:** $0
**Result:** 20-30 vetted influencers

**vs Buying database:** $89 for 23k unvetted profiles

**Recommendation:** Do BOTH
- Manual search for first campaign (quality)
