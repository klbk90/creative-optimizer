## 📋 General Guidelines for ALL Briefs

### Finding Quality Creators on Fiverr

**Filter by:**
- ⭐ 4.9+ rating
- 💯 1000+ reviews
- 🏆 Level 2 or Top Rated seller
- 📍 Native English speaker (if targeting US/UK)
- 🎬 Portfolio with vertical videos

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Generic portfolio (stock footage)
- ❌ No authentic UGC examples
- ❌ Promises unrealistic turnaround (1 day for custom video)
- ❌ Too cheap (<$50 - you get what you pay for)

### Providing Reference Videos

**Good references:**
1. TikTok organic videos (NOT ads) with similar energy
2. Instagram Reels from real users
3. Videos in same niche (lootbox → show other lootbox UGC)

**How to share:**
```
Reference 1: https://tiktok.com/@user/video/123 (love the hook)
Reference 2: https://tiktok.com/@user/video/456 (love the pacing)
Reference 3: https://tiktok.com/@user/video/789 (love the emotion)
```

### Communication Tips

**Initial message:**
```
Hi! I'm looking for a UGC creator for a [product category] app.

Budget: $[amount]
Timeline: [days]
Format: Vertical video (9:16)
Length: 10-15 seconds

I have a detailed brief ready. Are you available?

Portfolio: Can you share examples of similar work?
```

**After they accept:**
- Share full brief (use templates above)
- Provide reference videos (3-5 examples)
- Send app access (if needed for screen recording)
- Clarify revision policy (usually 1-2 revisions included)

### Revision Requests

If video needs changes:

**Good revision request:**
```
Thanks for the video! It's close, but a few tweaks:

1. Hook: Can we try "Wait for it..." instead of "Check this out"?
2. Energy: The 6-second mark feels slow - can you speed up that cut?
3. CTA: Add text overlay "Download Now" at the end

Everything else looks great! 🎯
```

**Bad revision request:**
```
This isn't what I wanted. Redo everything.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Batch Ordering

Order **3 variations** from same creator:
- Hook variation: "Wait" vs "Question" vs "Bold Claim"
- Emotion variation: Excitement vs Curiosity vs FOMO
- CTA variation: Direct vs Urgency vs Scarcity

**Why?** Find winning pattern faster + volume discount

### Rapid Testing Strategy

```
Week 1: Order 10 videos ($1,000-1,500)
Week 2: Analyze with Creative API
Week 3: Test top 5 on Spark Ads ($500 budget)
Week 4: Scale winner to $5,000+
```

### Pattern Insights

After testing 20+ creatives, check top patterns:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/creative/patterns/top?product_category=lootbox&metric=cvr
```

**Use insights to refine future briefs!**

Example: If "wait" hook + "excitement" emotion = 15% CVR, order MORE videos with that pattern.
