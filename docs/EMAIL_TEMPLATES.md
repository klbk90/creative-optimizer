# Cold Email Templates for Client Outreach

## Template 1: Direct Value Prop (Best for first contact)

**Subject:** Free UGC creative testing for [Company Name]

---

Hi [Founder Name],

I'm reaching out because [Company Name] looks like a perfect fit for something we're testing.

**Quick context:**
We built an AI platform that finds winning UGC creatives through micro-influencer testing. Think of it as "creative validation before you spend big on ads."

**What we do:**
- Find 10-20 micro-influencers (10k-50k followers) in your niche
- Generate AI-powered creative briefs tailored to your product
- Collect UGC content and test via TikTok/Meta Ads
- Show you which hooks/emotions actually drive installs & purchases

**The ask:**
Looking for 2-3 companies to pilot this for FREE (you just cover the ad spend ~$500-1000 for testing).

Interested? I can show you:
1. UGC analysis of [Competitor] campaigns
2. Creative patterns that work in [EdTech/Fitness]
3. Live demo of the platform

15 min call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Platform URL]

P.S. Saw you're YC W23 - congrats on the traction!

## Template 2: Problem-Focused (If they're running ads already)

**Subject:** Your TikTok ads could be 3x better (data from 10k creatives)

---

Hi [Founder Name],

Quick question: When you test new ad creatives, how do you know which hook will actually convert before spending $10k+?

Most teams guess. We use data from 10,000+ analyzed creatives to predict winners.

**Example:**
For [similar app], we found:
- "Wait for it..." hooks: 2.3% CVR
- "This changed my life..." hooks: 4.8% CVR
→ 2x difference just from the first 3 seconds

**What if you could test 20 variations through micro-influencers for under $1k?**

That's what we built. AI finds the right influencers, generates briefs, tracks conversions, and tells you exactly what to scale.

Want to see how it works for [EdTech/Fitness] apps? I can show you:
- Competitor creative analysis
- Which hooks/pacing work in your niche
- Expected ROI from influencer tests

Free pilot for first 3 companies. Interested?

## Template 3: Social Proof Version (After first client success)

**Subject:** How [Client Name] found their winning creative in 2 weeks

---

Hi [Founder Name],

[Client Name] just went from 1.2% to 4.5% conversion rate by testing UGC creatives through our platform.

**Their process:**
- Week 1: We found 15 language learning micro-influencers
- Week 2: Collected 12 UGC videos, ran ads with $800 budget
- Result: Found 2 winning creatives (4.5% CVR vs their 1.2% baseline)
- Now: Scaling those winners with $50k/month budget

**The secret?**
AI-powered creative analysis from 10,000+ ads + micro-influencer testing (cheaper than production studios, more authentic).

Wondering if this could work for [Your Company]?

I can show you:
1. What creative patterns work for apps like yours
2. Which influencers in your niche have best engagement
3. Expected ROI from a $1k test

Interested in a quick 15 min demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 4: The "Audit" Approach

**Subject:** Noticed your TikTok campaign - quick question

---

Hi [Founder Name],

Saw [Company Name]'s recent TikTok ads (love the [specific detail about their ad]).

Quick question: Do you track which creative elements (hook, pacing, CTA) actually drive conversions vs just views?

I built an AI platform that analyzes UGC creatives and predicts performance before you spend big.

**For example, looking at your current ads:**
- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]
- [Potential improvement]

Would you be open to a free creative audit? I can show you:
- What's working vs what could improve
- Benchmark data from similar apps in [niche]
- How to test variations through micro-influencers

No strings attached - just want to show you what our AI sees.
